# AED Final Project

This app is created for fighting food wastage with organic produce and groceries delivered to customers in need at cheaper prices than grocery stores. It's affordable because it consists of groceries which are regarded as not suitable for main market because of various reasons one of them being to fail to meet standards for colour and appearance. This will remove the third party that discards the food and it will be delivered directly from farmers to warehouses to customers. The food which is identified at a risk of going bad will be listed on the app for speedy consumption. The customer can subscribe to the app and place an order. The order will be assigned to the deliveryman who will directly take the items from warehouse and deliver to the customers.
