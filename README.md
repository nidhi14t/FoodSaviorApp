This app is created for fighting food wastage with organic produce such as fruits and vegetables, delivered to customers in need at cheaper prices than grocery stores. It's affordable because it consists of produce which are regarded as not suitable for main market because of various reasons one of them being to fail to meet standards for color and appearance. This will remove the third party that discards the food, and it will be delivered directly from farmers to warehouses to customers. The food which is identified at a risk of going bad will be listed on the app for speedy consumption. This will benefit greatly to NGOs who require to feed the less privileged people and help them to get the daily nutrition.
